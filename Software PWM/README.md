# Software PWM
PWM (pulse width modulation) has alot of data signal processing applications.  In the context of LED's, PWM makes an LED look dimmer than if it is a straight signal.  This is because the LED is flashing rather than staying on.  If the PWM is 100%, it is as bright at that current as possible.  If the PWM is less, than the LED will appear dimmer.  This program starts a led at 50% PWM and at a button press it goes up 10% and raps around after 100%.
